Hi!

I'm Jesse

I'm the Perl 5 "Pumpking"

Pumpking?

Pumpkin

Patch Pumpkin

"Patch" Pumpkin?


"       To explain:  David Croy once told me once that at a previous job, there was one tape drive and multiple systems that
       used it for backups.  But instead of some high-tech exclusion software, they used a low-tech method to prevent
       multiple simultaneous backups: a stuffed pumpkin.  No one was allowed to make backups unless they had the "backup
       pumpkin".

5.12.0! Yay

5.12? I thought Perl 6 was next.

No.

So, I hate Perl 6?

No.

Perl 6 is awesome

Perl 6 is the future

Perl 6 is one future

Perl 5 is one future

Perl 5 and Perl 6 are sisters

Perl 5 and Perl 6 are friends

So.

What's new in 5.12

[technical content]

[benchmarks]

Lots of this was new in 5.10.1, too.

What was new in 5.10.0

New release process

New pumpking

    (Me)

What a pumpking was

    Hardcore C hacker
    Patch applier
    Language Designer
    Release Engineer
    HR Manager 
    Supreme Arbiter of Good taste
    Project Manager
    Dispute Resolver

Wow. That's a lot of stuff.

Who have our pumpkings been?

       Larry Wall, Andy Dougherty, Tom Christiansen, Charles Bailey, Nick Ing-
       Simmons, Chip Salzenberg, Tim Bunce, Malcolm Beattie, Gurusamy Sarathy,
       Graham Barr, Jarkko Hietaniemi, Hugo van der Sanden, Michael Schwern,
       Rafael Garcia-Suarez, Nicholas Clark, Richard Clamp, Leon Brocard, Dave
       Mitchell.

How do you get to be pumpking?

Be a hardcore C hacker

With a responsibility complex.

That's right.

We made our best hackers into project managers

Nobody since Larry has stayed pumpking for two maint versions.

We can't keep losing pumpkings!

What can we do?

Refactoring!

Role decomposition?
   

What is the pumpking?
 
Hardcore C hacker

    Don't need to be! 

Patch applier

    Sure, but it can be shared

Release Engineer

    That can be delegated!

Language Designer

    That can be delegated 
    (Somewhat)

Supreme Arbiter of Good taste
    That can't be delegated

Dispute Resolver
    That can't be delegated


HR Manager 
    
    That can't be delegated

Project Manager

    That can't be delegated

Maintenance Release

"Maintenance" Release

Perl 5.10.0

December 2007 

Rafael Garcia Suarez (rgs)

Resigned July 2009

Perl 5.10.1

Dave Mitchell (dapm)

August 2009

Retired October 2009

"Over about 18 months, 5.10.1 included about 2800 commits that were
cherry-picked from blead, (and there were a further 700 or so blead
commits that weren't picked)"
	
	"Maint currently serves the following goals:
	
	1) include regression fixes
	2) include general fixes
	3) include build fixes (so it will compile on new/updated platforms)
	4) include newer CPAN modules related to (3)
	5) generally update CPAN modules where newer releases are available
	6) include new features that aren't too scary and don't break
	   backwards compatibility
	7) maintain binary compatibility
	8) don't break anything.
	
	Doing all the above is *very* hard."
	
We can't keep losing pumpkings

New maint policy

"New releases of maint should contain as few changes as possible.
If there is any question about whether a given patch might merit
inclusion in a maint release, then it almost certainly should not
be included."

What's OK

	Portability fixes, such as changes to Configure and the files in
	hints/ are acceptable. 
	
	Documentation updates
	
	Patches that fix crashing bugs that do not otherwise change Perl's
	functionality or negatively impact performance
	
	Patches that fix CVEs or security issues
	
	Minimal patches to dual-life modules to
	ifx crashing or security issues (as above).
	
What's not OK

	Patches that add new warnings or errors or deprecate features
	
	New versions of dual-life modules.
	(Except as above)
	
	Patches that break binary compatibility.
	
	Patches that add or remove features.
	
	Ports of Perl to a new platform, architecture
	or OS release that involve changes to the implementation
	
When's 5.12.1 coming?

Estimated: May 12, 2010

So, what's coming in 5.12.1?

When's 5.14 coming?

What's coming in 5.14?

I don't know 

What do you want in Perl 5.14?
